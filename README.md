# Object Relations Code Challenge - Restaurants

For this challenge, we are working with a Yelp-style domain.
 

We have three models:
- `Restaurant`
- `Customer`
- `Review`
 

For our purposes, a `Restaurant` has many `Reviews`, a `Customer` has many `Reviews`, and a `Review` belongs to a `Customer` and to a `Restaurant`.
 

`Restaurant` - `Customer` is a many-to-many relationship.


Topics covered: 
- Classes and Instances
- Class and Instance Methods
- Variable Scope
- Object Relationships
- lists and list Methods
